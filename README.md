# Weather app

This assignment was an introduction to React basics at Chas Academy in the spring of 2018.

The app uses [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net) for the weather data and location search with [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start).

Only vanilla react state to see its ease of use and what its weaknesses are, compared to something like Redux that would be overkill for this use case.

Feautres

- Get weather by current location (geolocation web api)
- Search weather by city or place
- Toggle displaying temperature between Celcius and Fahrenheit
